# automata
I'm kinda playing a game of life here 🃏

### About
This is just another implementation of Conway's game of life.

Made when I was reading [The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/).

### How to run

Simply run a HTTP server on the repository root.

Or see it live [here](https://dmrib.github.io/automata).
